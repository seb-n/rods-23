    "# 1. Playing with Masked Language Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Masked Language Models (MLMs) are language models that are trained to predict which masked token is missing from a sequence. For example, given a sequence **\"My cat is [MASK]\"**, a good MLM would predict a word like \"black\" or \"furry\". This kind of pre-training was popularized with BERT model, and is still widely used. There are many versions of MLM-based models of different sizes on [HuggingFace model hub](https://huggingface.co/models). The example uses BERT, but you can browse and choose something else, e.g. a RoBERTa or AlBERT-based models. There is even a [Danish BERT](https://huggingface.co/Maltehb/danish-bert-botxo).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let us see how we can test a MLM for any stereotypes! For this we will use the core masked language model task: filling in the blanks with the missing words. \n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, if you ask the model to complete the sentence \"I ate __ for breakfast\", it should complete the sentence with words denoting food rather than e.g. furniture. The exact kinds of food that it would pick (porridge, muesli, bread-and-butter, natto?) would likely reflect the prevalent co-occurrence pattern in its training data, which in its turn says something about the people who wrote those texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to do this is to initialize the Masked Language Model [pipeline](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v4.10.1/main_classes/pipelines.html#fillmaskpipeline) and pass it the name of your model as `model` argument (the name comes from the Hugging Face hub. Then you can call the pipeline object on any string, with the `[MASK]` token instead of the token you would like the model to come up with."
